## Project Overview  
This project explores **Airbnb listing trends**, including pricing, availability, and neighborhood insights. The dataset was cleaned and transformed before creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key patterns.

##  Problem Statement  
The short-term rental market is highly dynamic, with prices, availability, and customer preferences constantly shifting. This analysis aims to answer key questions such as:
- Which neighborhoods have the highest number of Airbnb listings?
- What factors influence pricing trends?
- How does availability vary across different regions?
- Which hosts have the most listings and reviews?

## Dataset Description  
- The dataset consists of **Airbnb listings** with details such as host information, pricing, location, availability, and reviews.
- The data was preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization
- **Power Querry** Data cleaning
- **Excel** 
  

## Data Cleaning 
Before building the dashboard, I performed the following data cleaning steps: 
✅ Removed unnecesary columns
✅ Removed duplicate listings  
✅ Handled missing values in price and review columns  
✅ Standardized date formats  
✅ Filtered outliers in price distributions

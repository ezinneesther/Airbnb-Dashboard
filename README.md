# Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Airbnb listings data, exploring pricing trends, availability, and customer reviews. The dashboard was created using **Power BI**, incorporating data cleaning, transformations, and visual insights.  

## Data Cleaning 
Before building the dashboard, I performed the following data cleaning steps:  
✅ Removed duplicate listings  
✅ Handled missing values in price and review columns  
✅ Standardized date formats  
✅ Filtered outliers in price distributions
